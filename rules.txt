SEGREGATION--------

	CELL COLORS:
		Red - Occupied by Population 1
		Blue - Occupied by Population 2
		White - Not occupied

	FROM XML: 
		Simulation Name: "Segregation"
		Simulation Author: "Thomas Schelling"
		
	PARAMETERS (also from XML):
		Double t - represents % of surrounding cells that must be same color for 
			       cell to not move locations
			       ** surrounding cells = adjacent and diagonal
		
		
	RULES:
		Let p represent (# of similar cells / # of neighbors) for each cell
		For each cell:
		1) If p < t:
			- find and change White cell to current color
			- change current cell to White
