User Interface

###Description
When the user runs the program, he or she will be prompted first with a pop up box
with two inputs.  The first is a drop down list titled Simulation Type, and the user can only pick from the options provided.  The second will be Grid Size with an open box for a typed input.  There will be a message that says "enter integer size for each dimension separated by an 'x', eg. 4x4x4 will produce a 3 Dimensional grid with sides of length 4."  If the user does not input integers separated by x's, they will receive the message "Error, incorrect size input."  Once those inputs are done correctly, the user will be prompted with another pop up box labeled "Parameters".  The options for these will depend on the simulation chosen, but it should entail a certain number of boxes expecting integer values with a short labeled description.  Once that is complete, the simulation will pop up and run until complete.
